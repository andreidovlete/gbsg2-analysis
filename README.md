# GBSG2 Breast Cancer Data Analysis

## Overview
This project performs statistical analysis and survival modeling on the GBSG2 (German Breast Cancer Study Group) dataset. The analysis focuses on understanding hormone receptor levels, comparing their distributions, examining variable correlations, and modeling survival probabilities based on lymph node involvement.

## Problem Solving Approach

1. **Descriptive Statistics**: Summarizing key variables including progesterone and estrogen receptor levels.
2. **Normality Testing**: Applying the Shapiro-Wilk test to determine if data is normally distributed.
3. **Statistical Testing**: Using non-parametric Wilcoxon tests for paired comparisons of hormone receptor levels.
4. **Correlation Analysis**: Creating a correlation heatmap of key clinical variables.
5. **Survival Analysis**: Using Kaplan-Meier estimators stratified by lymph node involvement.
6. **Predictive Modeling**: Estimating survival probabilities for new hypothetical patients.

This approach ensures appropriate statistical tests and models are applied based on data distribution and research questions.

## Platform and Tools

- **Language**: R
- **Libraries**:
  - `TH.data`: Provides GBSG2 dataset
  - `tidyverse`, `ggplot2`: Data manipulation and visualization
  - `survival`, `survminer`: Survival modeling
  - `reshape2`: Data reshaping for visualization

## Followed Steps

1. Imported and cleaned the GBSG2 dataset from the `TH.data` package.
2. Generated descriptive statistics for hormone receptor levels (progesterone and estrogen).
3. Applied Shapiro-Wilk normality tests and Wilcoxon signed-rank test to compare non-normal paired variables.
4. Produced correlation matrices and visualized them with heatmaps.
5. Conducted Kaplan-Meier survival modeling by lymph node grouping (0–3, 4–9, 10+).
6. Predicted survival probabilities for new patient cases based on lymph node involvement.
7. Exported all relevant figures to EPS format for LaTeX compatibility.

## Justification

- **R** was chosen for its powerful statistical libraries and reproducibility.
- **Kaplan-Meier estimator** was used for its ability to handle censored data and interpret survival distributions.
- **Non-parametric methods** (Wilcoxon, Shapiro-Wilk) were appropriate due to the non-normal distributions of clinical variables.
- Results follow established statistical methods (e.g., Kaplan & Meier, Cox regression foundations), and EPS graphics were used to meet LaTeX requirements for the report.

## Key Results

- Hormone receptor levels show **significant variability**, with non-normal distributions confirmed by Shapiro-Wilk.
- **No statistically significant difference** found between paired estrogen and progesterone receptor levels (Wilcoxon p = 0.11).
- **Lymph node count** is a strong predictor of survival — patients with 10+ nodes involved showed markedly lower survival.
- **Kaplan-Meier survival estimates**:
  - 0 days: 100%
  - 1500 days: ~60%
  - 2500 days: ~30%

## Significant Test Data and Results

### Descriptive Statistics
| Statistic           | Progesterone (progrec) | Estrogen (estrec) |
|---------------------|-------------------------|-------------------|
| Mean                | 130.50                  | 184.01            |
| Median              | 120.00                  | 160.00            |
| Std Dev             | 82.23                   | 98.15             |
| Min                 | 0                       | 0                 |
| Max                 | 500                     | 500               |
| IQR                 | 120                     | 160               |

### Normality Tests
- **Progrec**: p < 0.001 → Not normally distributed  
- **Estrec**: p < 0.001 → Not normally distributed

### Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test
- **Progrec vs Estrec**: p < 0.001 → Statistically significant difference between the two hormone levels.

### Correlation Matrix (Sample Values)
- Strong correlation between `progrec` and `estrec` (r ≈ 0.74)  
- Moderate negative correlation between `age` and `tsize` (r ≈ -0.14)

### Age Distribution
- Most patients are between **40–70 years**.  
- Distribution is slightly right-skewed.

### Contingency Table: Hormonal Treatment vs. Censoring
| Hormonal Treatment | Censored = 0 | Censored = 1 |
|--------------------|--------------|--------------|
| no                 | 75           | 99           |
| yes                | 97           | 138          |

No strong indication of imbalance, but slightly more censored patients had hormonal treatment.

### Kaplan-Meier Survival Analysis
- Patients grouped by lymph node involvement:
  - **0–3 Nodes**: Highest survival rate
  - **4–9 Nodes**: Moderate survival rate
  - **10+ Nodes**: Significantly lower survival
- Clear separation between survival curves, confirming lymph node involvement is a strong prognostic factor.

### Survival Predictions for New Patients (Day 1000)
| Age | Tumor Size | Nodes | Progrec | Estrec | Group         | Survival Probability |
|-----|------------|--------|---------|--------|---------------|-----------------------|
| 55  | 25         | 6      | 60      | 40     | 4–9 Nodes     | 85%                   |
| 65  | 35         | 12     | 90      | 70     | 10+ Nodes     | 62%                   |

These predictions provide interpretable survival expectations based on lymph node grouping.

## Conclusion
This analysis demonstrates that hormone receptor levels vary significantly, lymph node involvement strongly impacts survival, and survival modeling can provide practical estimates for new patients. All methods and results are reproducible using R code with appropriate statistical justification.
